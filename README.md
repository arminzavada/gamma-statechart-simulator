# gamma-statechart-simulator
 My Training Project Laboratory course's home assignement on the Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

## Building

In order to use this simulator, you need to export [active_state](https://github.com/rokkerboci/gamma-statechart-simulator/tree/main/additional/com.triad.school.gamma.simulator.active_state) plugin. This is because if it were a part of the rest of the plugin, the gamma statechart metamodel would have 2 uri-s instead of one.
