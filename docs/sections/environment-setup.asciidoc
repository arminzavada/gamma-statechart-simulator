= Gamma

This plugin uses https://inf.mit.bme.hu/en/gamma[Gamma] to function, please follow their setup guide!

= Peculiar bug

Because of a bug, the `Gamma Statechart Model` can't be imported to the same workspace as the rest of the plugin -> in order to use, you have to export the `Gamma Statechart Model` as a plugin, and install it into your Eclipse.
