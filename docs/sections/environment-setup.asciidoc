= Gamma and Eclipse

This plugin uses https://inf.mit.bme.hu/en/gamma[Gamma] to function, please follow their setup guide!

This includes:
 * Gamma
 * Eclipse
 * Yakindu (you may need a license)
 * Viatra
 * EMF
 * Xtext
 * Xtend

This is everything you need to start developing.

== Peculiar bug

Because of a bug, the `Gamma Statechart Model` can't be imported to the same workspace as the rest of the plugin -> in order to use, you have to export the `Gamma Statechart Model` as a plugin, and install it into your Eclipse.
